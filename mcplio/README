This library provides MCPL I/O functions to SIMRES.

See the mcpl/* for the 3rd party MCPL files. 
See https://github.com/mctools/mcpl for the MCPL project.

How to compile mcplio.so with gcc:

Linux:
make -f makefile_linux BIN=[bin] LIB=[lib]

Windows:
make -f makefile_windows BIN=[bin] LIB=[lib]

where
[bin] stands for the target directory for object files and dll
[lib] stands for the target directory for *.so and import library (Windows only)

When calling make with "-C directory" option, the [lib] and [bin] directories must be 
eithe relative to directory, or absolute
