---------------------------------------------------------------------
McStas compile scripts for mingw-w64 (Windows) and gcc (Linux) are included. You may need
to edit them to reflect actual McStas installation. 

NOTE:
The component file MCPL_output.comp from McStas v6.5 has a bug which has been fixed in the local copy (issue #836) 

see ../readme.txt for information about this demo.
