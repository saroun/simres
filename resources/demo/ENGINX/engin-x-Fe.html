  Examples in this project include:
<ul>
<li> Example of strain scanning through the surface of a stress-free ferrite sample, <code>engin-x-Fe.xml</code></li>
<li>Simulation of gauge volume and export of a file with scattering events, <code>engin-x-Fe-1mm-gauge.xml</code></li>
</ul>
  Instrument configuration corresponds to the time-of-flight engineering diffractometer ENGIN-X at ISIS.

  Use the commands in the attached *.inp scripts to perform various settings and commands.<BR />
  You can open the script in the Tools/Script editor and run selected blocks (select text by mouse, then "Run selected"). See the comments at the command blocks in the scripts for brief explanations.

  <TD align="LEFT">Example with simulation of sampling distribution for 1x1x5 mm collimation. It permits to simulate, view and export sampling distribution as a list of event data in an ASCII file: 
  position, incident and exit k-vecotors, probability, time and "as measured" dhkl for selected intrinsic dhkl. 
  It can be useful e.g. for evaluation of smearing and pseudo-strain effects using another code (it can be faster than ray-tracing simulation, which can do it also, of course).<BR />
  Relevant commands are saved in the script <code>engin-x-Fe-1mm-gauge.inp</code>.
