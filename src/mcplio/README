Source files for compiling libmcplio.so library.
This library provides MCPL I/O functions to SIMRES.

See the mcpl/* for the 3rd party MCPL files. 
See https://github.com/mctools/mcpl for the MCPL project.

How to compile mcplio.so with gcc:

Linux:
make -f makefile_linux BIN=[bin] MCPLSRC=[src]

Windows:
make -f makefile_windows BIN=[bin] MCPLSRC=[src]

where
[bin] stands for the target directory for object files, *.dll, *.so
[src] stands for the directory with MCPL source files 

When calling make with "-C directory" option, the [lib] and [src] directories must be 
either relative to this directory, or absolute
